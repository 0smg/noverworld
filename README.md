# Noverworld

When you create a new world your hotbar is replaced with the ninth saved creative hotbar (set with `c + 9`). 

You will spawn in the nether inside a portal with a random yaw (facing angle). Depending on the version you are using
the f3 menu and pie chart will be automatically opened for you.

The y height of the portal the mod attempts to target is determined using the following distribution:
- 80% chance of between 7-13
- 5% chance of between 14-59
- 10% chance of between 60-75
- 5%  of between 76-90

The distribution was chosen in a fairly arbitrary manner. Make an issue if you want it changed.

This mod has been tested with:
- Sodium
- Lithium
- Starlight
- FastReset
- LazyDFU
- Moonlight (threaded stronghold gen)
- Chunk mod (puts you in the world before spawn chunks have finished generating)

I will not support multithreaded world gen such as C2ME.

Contributions are welcome.
